# Personalised-Humor-Classification-using-LLMs
Personalised humour classification with three labels: funny / not_funny / donâ€™t_understand, using a cross-cultural dataset and user context (age, gender, ethnicity). Includes reproducible baselines (TF-IDF+LR, DistilBERT), a RoBERTa+demographics (LoRA) novelty model, and a two-stage meta pipeline with calibrated evaluation and explainability.
