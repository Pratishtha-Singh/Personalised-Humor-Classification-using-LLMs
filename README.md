# Personalised Humor Classification using LLMs

A comprehensive machine learning project for personalised humor classification that predicts how individuals perceive jokes based on demographic context. The system classifies jokes into three categories: **funny**, **not_funny**, or **don't_understand**, considering user demographics (age, gender, ethnicity).

## 🎯 Project Overview

This project implements multiple approaches to humor classification, from traditional machine learning baselines to advanced transformer models and large language models (LLMs). The goal is to create a personalized humor recommendation system that understands individual preferences and cultural contexts.

### Key Features

- **Multi-label Classification**: Three-way classification (funny/not_funny/don't_understand)
- **Demographic-aware**: Incorporates user age, gender, and ethnicity
- **Cross-cultural Dataset**: Diverse joke collection with user responses
- **Multiple Model Architectures**: From TF-IDF to transformer models
- **Calibrated Predictions**: Uncertainty-aware outputs
- **Interactive Dashboard**: Streamlit-based visualization and testing interface

## 📊 Dataset

The project uses a curated humor dataset containing:
- **Joke texts** from various sources and cultures
- **User demographics** (age groups, gender, ethnicity)
- **Response labels** (funny/not_funny/don't_understand)
- **Cross-cultural representation** for diverse humor understanding

## 🏗️ Model Architectures

### 1. Baseline Models
- **TF-IDF + Logistic Regression**: Traditional NLP approach
- **DistilBERT**: Pre-trained transformer baseline

### 2. Novelty Model
- **RoBERTa + Demographics**: Fine-tuned with LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation)
- **Demographic Integration**: Age, gender, and ethnicity embeddings
- **Cost-sensitive Training**: Handles class imbalance

### 3. LLM Approach
- **Gemini Integration**: Using Google's Gemini model for few-shot classification
- **Prompt Engineering**: Carefully crafted prompts for demographic-aware humor understanding

### 4. Meta Pipeline
- **Two-stage Classification**: Combines multiple model predictions
- **Calibrated Outputs**: Uncertainty quantification
- **Ensemble Methods**: Leverages strengths of different approaches
